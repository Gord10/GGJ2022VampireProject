<color=red>"Blood sucker"</color>, they call you. <color=red>"Creature of the night"</color>.
You are potent and fast, but you didn't choose this <i>unlife</i>.
In the duality between life and unlife, you always wanted to taste the pleasures that life brings.
Rather than being jailed in the coldness of the graveyard you are cursed to spend the eternity.
There are 7 goblets in the graveyard, bringing them to your coffin will grant you Deliverance from the unlife.
You still need to feed from the villagers.
But if you feed too much, you will turn into a monster without any willpower.
